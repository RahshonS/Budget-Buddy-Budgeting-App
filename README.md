### Purpose of the Project
The Budget Buddy Budgeting App is an application that helps users easily manage their finances on a month-to-month basis. This application is geared towards college students who wish to engage in better financial practices, save money, and create a sustainable financial plan for the future. With this application, users will be able to create a monthly budget and closely monitor their daily spending habits. At the end of every month, users will be provided with feedback informing them on how well they did, as well as areas on which they could improve on.
